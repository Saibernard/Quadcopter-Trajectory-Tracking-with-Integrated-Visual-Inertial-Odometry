# Quadcopter-Trajectory-Tracking-with-Integrated-Visual-Inertial-Odometry
This repository delves into the intricate integration of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) with quadcopter trajectory planning and control. Leveraging state estimation, we devise a robust flight plan and control strategy, ensuring stable and accurate flights in GPS-denied environments.
